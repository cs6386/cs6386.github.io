## Course Description:
This course delves into the principles of managing large-scale datasets with the goal of designing an efficient data science pipeline. It encompasses a diverse set of topics, such as data acquisition, visualization, preparation, validation, and analysis. As we go through these modules, you'll also engage in extensive paper readings and reviews, enriching your understanding with the latest research and innovative approaches in the field. Students will apply the learned techniques as a part of an open-ended project.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
<br> &#x2022; Implement the principles of data management to a real-world problem.
<br> &#x2022; Design complex data processing pipelines by combining data from different
sources and visualizing it.
<br> &#x2022; Evaluate the impact of noise on the quality of data analysis and design methods
to get rid of it.
<br> &#x2022; Critically evaluate scientific papers from the data management research
community and prepare presentations covering these topics.


## Prerequisites:
If you are an undergraduate, you should have taken CS 4780 or an equivalent course, since it is a prerequisite. For all others, knowledge of machine learning at the level of CS 4780 is needed.
