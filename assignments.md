# Project

The subject of the project is open-ended where students need to do at least the following:
1. implement the end to end data science pipeline for some task
2. explore the different techniques for concepts learned in the class and qualitatively evaluate their need for this task
3. develop a customized solution for the application
4. empirically evaluate the performance (quality, efficiency, robustness) of the developed system and compare with baseline techniques
5. [Optional] Build a demo or easy to use library
